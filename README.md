# FFlag Discord Bot ðŸš©
A discord bot which allows you to control feature flags, right inside of discord!

This is the first frontend for my [backend fflag api](https://github.com/29cmb/FFlagAPI)

The bot can be added to your server through [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1275172440695246979&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot)
